Introduction\n### Business Problem\nWhen people travel to different cities they often want to be located near places they either want to visit, or will find useful (depending on reason for travel). A travel agent might be able to suggest hotels to stay that fit these criteria, but as we have seen with the rise of websites like Booking.com having a website to visit that can tell you details about the hotels and what they are near is useful. The business problem I propose is how to efficienly and effectively find somewhere to stay in a city you have never been to.\nPeople who would be interested in this problem: Frequent travellers, travel agents, websites like Booking.com. \n\n### The Data\nThe data provided by FoursquareAPI will be used to find all of the hotels in my city, London. It will then also be used to find all of the places of interest within a certain distance of those hotels and rank them closest to farthest. After that the hotels will be clustered. I hope this will provide a useful lisst of hotels, clustered by amenities(places of interest), and also ranked by how close they are to those amenities.
